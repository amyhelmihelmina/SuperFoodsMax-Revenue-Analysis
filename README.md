# SuperFoodsMax-Revenue-Analysis
Background:
This analysis is the capstone project for a professional certificate with RMIT University Online: Business Analytics with SQL and Python.

## Executive Summary
Using SQL and Python, I pulled transaction data from database and prepared a powerpoint presentation for the management. After identifying that the biggeset revenue opportunities is to increase loyal customers, I recommend the following be made the marketing focus:

  1. Keep younger customers engage.
  2. Retain customers from different household type.

## Business Problems
Provide insights that can support the management's proposal to focus on converting non-loyalists into loyalists to increase revenue.

## Methodology
1. Dataset was downloaded from course-approved database in the form of CSV.
2. CSV loaded to pgadmin4, where SQL queries were used to clean, sort and transform dataset.
3. Use Python on notebook to explore data.
4. Summarise findings in PowerPoint to be shared with the management.

## Skills
1. SQL: JOIN, LIMIT
2. Python: Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, 
3. MS PowerPoint: slide preparation, screencasting

## Results & Business Recommendations

1. Younger customers (students and youth) made the most of company customers. I recommend the company improve its online shopping experience to appeal more to the younger, tech-savvy customers. Additionally, lack of online shopping was identified as the reason sales decline in 2019 as Covid-19 rampaged the world.
2. Company may also assess the suitability to set up age-based customer loyalty programmes. This may include curated and discounted back-to-college sections, accessible to those with valid student IDs. 
3. To retain customers from different household types, I recommend the company provide family-friendly shopping experiences, such as drive-through pick up services, and developing family-friendly customer loyalty rewards.
